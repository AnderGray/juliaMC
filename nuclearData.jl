# In here all of the nuclear data business will be done. We will have a nuclide object, a crossection object, and a summed crossection object. We should also have place to hold and the exit probabilities of reactions. We should also make use of a feature of julia that is we can treat some objects like functions. So to the crossection object we can ask it for an energy and it should do all of the interpolation within that object
